# A Cross-Modal Aware Scalable Approach for Fake News Detection

This project was developed for my final master's computing project. The project makes use of pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models to detect fake text and images. 

This project was presented at the 17th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE) 2024.
